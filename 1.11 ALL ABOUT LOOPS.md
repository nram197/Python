repeat a particular task based on some conditions for some fixed number of times called as looping

Statements in python are executed sequentially i.e. from first statement of block to second and so on
	times we may need to execute a block several number of times this is done by loop statement

repetitive execution of same block of code over and over is called iteration
- loop used for sequential traversal i.e. ability to iterate over the items of any sequence like a list or string
- a variable takes the value of the item inside the sequence on each iteration
- body of loop is separated from rest using indentation

**Definitive iteration**
	specified explicitly in advance
	eg. For loop
	number of iterations is known
**In-definitive iteration**
	executes until some condition is met
	eg. While loop
	number of iterations is unknown
### Range
- built-in function
- used when user needs to perform action for a specific number of times(within a given range)
- range() function used to generate a sequence of numbers and ==used mostly with For loop==
**Arguments of range()**
**start** - it is an integer starting from which the sequence of integers is to be returned
**stop** - it is an integer before which the sequence of integers is to be returned. The range of integers ends at stop -1. 
**step(optional)** - it is an integer value which determines the increment between each integer in the sequence.
- start from zero and run until range -1 because stop value in range function is excluded.
```py
print(list(range(5)))
print(list(range(1,5)))
print(list(range(1,10,2)))
```
>Note:
>	to print values generated by range function it has to be wrapped inside a list()
>	list - is a collection of elements that are ordered and changeable

### For loop
in for loop increment done internally 
```py
for val in sequence:
	statements
```
```py
for i in range(5):
	print(i)
for i in range(5):
	print("python")
for i in "python":
	print(i)
```
### While loop
when condition becomes false the line after the loop is executed
```py
while boolean_expression:
	statements
```
- when boolean_expression is first evaluated and if its true the loop body is executed
- continues until repeated true once false moves to next line after loop
- first need to definite a variable and intialize it
- the increment it one by one
- in while loop increment done manually
```py
i=0
while i<3:
	print("I love python")
	i=i+1
```

### Break statement
using loops automates and repeats the tasks in efficient manner

sometimes you need to exit the loop before the end condition arrives done using loop control statement called Break statement

terminate the loop

if its present in nested loop  only those loops that contain break statement are terminated

```py
str="Good morning"
for i in str:
	if i=="m":
		break
	else:
		print(i)
```

```py
n=200
threhold=n(50.0/100.0)
for i in range(0,n,10):
	if i>threshold:
		print("50% capacity reached")
		break
	else:
		print("passengers onboarded",i)
```
```py
num=int(input("enter the number which need to generate multiplication table"))
for i in range(1,11):
	print(num,'x',i,'=',num*i)
```
```py
num=int"input the number till you want to generate even numbers"
i=0
while i<=num:
	if i%2==0:
		print(i)
	i=i+1
```
