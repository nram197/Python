indentation must or else python doesn't know what to execute next or which statement belongs to which block

### Indentation error

in c / c++ / java we use {} curly braces to indicate start and end of block code 
in python we use space / tab 
	i.e. statements with same spaces to right belongs to same code block 
	statements belonging to a block will start from the same vertical line

-if first statement is indented with a tab the next statement should be intented with 2 tabs
