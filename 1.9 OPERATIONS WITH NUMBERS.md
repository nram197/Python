Reusability one of reason to love python
	tons of modules already available so no need to make something from absolute scratch
### Modules
they are pre-written codes with some functionality than can be added to your code
- to use a module you need to import that module in our file using 'import' keyword 
```import module_name```

from - add only a particular part of the module based on requirements if whole module is added it might slow the program

```from module_name import something```
	here something is part of module such as function or class or static variable
#### Math module
http://docs.python.org/3/library/math.html
- always available
- similar to C mathematical functions (C standard) written in cpython
- trigonometric, logarithmic, representation, angle conversion etc.

**import math**

some functions
- ceil(x) - returns the smallest integer greater than or equal to x
- floor(x) - returns the largest integer less than or equal to x
- fabs(x) -  returns the absolute value of x
- factorial(x) -  returns the factorial of x
- fmod(x.y) -  returns the remainder when x is divided by y
- log2(x) -  returns the base 2 logarithm of x
- log10(x) - returns the base 10 logarithm of x
- pow(x.y) - returns x raised to the power y
- sqrt(x) - returns the square root of x
- trunc(x) - returns the truncated integer value of x
```
import module_name
module_name.function()
```
eg:
```py
import math
print(math.sqrt(4))
```
### Trigonometric

degrees()
radians()

some functions
- sin(x) - returns the sine of x in radians
- cos(x) - returns the cosine of x in radians
- tan(x) - returns the tangent of x in radians
- degrees(x) - converts angle x from radians to degrees
- radians(x) - converts angle x from degrees to radians

### Constants
these values are fixed by unambiguous definition and are referred in symbols
math module offers a variety of predefined constants
- you dont have to hard-code them
- they provide consistency throughout code
- eg: pi, tau=2pi, Euler's number, infinity
eg:
```
print(math.pi)
print(math.tau)
print(math.e)
print("Positive Infinity-",math.inf)
print("Negative Infinity-",-math.inf)
``` 
### Python Random module
python has random build-in module to generate random numbers
defined by a set of functions that are used to generate or manipulate random numbers.
- used in games, lotteries, data science, image processing etc.
http://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html

some uses
- seed() - initialize the random number generator
- randrange(x,y,step) - returns a random number between the given range
- randint(x,y) - returns a random number between the given range
- choice(sequence) - returns a random element from the given sequence
- shuffle(sequence) - takes a sequence and returns the sequence in a random order
- random() - returns a random float number between 0 and 1
eg:
```py
import random
print(random.random())
print(random.randint(1,100))
print(random.randrange(1,10))
print(random.randrange(1,10,2))
```
