COMPILED LANGUAGE 

- converted to machine code so they are faster and efficient than interpreted language
- they need build step that need to be manually compiled first and need to be rebuild every time you make a change
- Wont run the code if there is an error in your code, it wont run until all errors are fixed
eg: C C++ RUST GO

INTERPRETED LANGUAGE
- interpreters run through a program line by line and execute each command
- significantly slower
- with development of just-in-time compilation the gap is shrinking 
- will run the code even if there is errors, at each error execution of code will stop with error  message highlighting the reason behind the issue
eg: PHP PYTHON RUBY JAVASCRIPT


Python 
interpreter executes the program directly translating each statement into a sequence of one or more subroutines and then into another language(machine code)
