like other data structure set store multiple elements and has some unique operations with it
**features**
- unordered collections and has no index attached to sets in python
- set elements are unique i.e. duplicates not allowed
- set itself can be modified but the elements in set are immutable

set created using **set()** function or placing all elements inside curly braces

==note:==
sets and dictionary have curly braces except dictionary are in key value pair
**{}** - means an empty dictionary 
this is why we have two methods to create a set 
```
# empty set
date=set()
print(type(data))
```
sets cannot have lists or dictionaries since sets are mutable whereas set elements are immutable
a valid set can have value of numeric, string, tuple, Boolean
```
setone={1,2,3}
settwo={4,5,6,"james"}
print(setone)
print(settwo)
```
### Accessing a set
- set is a collection data type so we can access values/elements from the sets
- but sets are unordered so we cannot use access elements using index
- so we cannot access an individual element but we can access elements one by one by looping through it
```
days={"monday","tuesday","wednesday","thursday","friday","saturday","sunday"}
for i in days:
	print(i)
```
### Set operations
**union of sets**
	is the elements that are in both sets
	thus producing a new set containing distinct elements from both sets
	performed using | operator and also using union() method
```
A={1,2,3,4,5}
B={4,5,6,7,8}
# using | operator
print(A|B)
# using union() method
print(A.union(B))
```
**set intersection**
	is the element that belong common to both sets
	performed using & operator and also using intersection() method
```
A={1,2,3,4,5}
B={4,5,6,7,8}
# using & operator
print(A & B)
# using intersection() method
print(A.intersection(B))
```
**difference of sets**
	producing a new set containing elements from first set and none elements from second set
	performed using - operator and also using difference() method
```
A={1,2,3,4,5}
B={4,5,6,7,8}
# using - operator
print(A - B)
print(B - A)
# using difference() method
print(A.difference(B))
print(B.difference(A))
```
### Build-in functions
**lens()** - returns the length of the set
**max()** - returns the largest item in the set
**min()** - returns the smallest item in the set
**sorted()** - returns the new sorted list from elements in the set. it does not sort the set itself.
**sum()** - returns the sum of all elements in the set
```
age={23,22,34,36,24,41}
print(len(age))
print(min(age))
print(max(age))
```
### Some other set methods
**add()** - adds an element to the set
**intersection()** - returns the intersection of two sets as a new set
**clear()** - removes all elements from the set
**copy()** - returns a copy of the set
**difference()** - returns the difference of two or more sets as a new set
**discard()** - removes an element from the set if it is a member 
**isdisjoint()** - it returns True if two sets have a null intersection
**issubset()** - it returns True if another set contains this set
**issuperset()** - it returns True if this set contains another set
**pop()** - it removes and returns an arbitrary set element
**remove()** - it removes an element from the set
**union()** - it returns the union of sets in a new set
**update()** - it updates the set with the union of itself and others
```
age={23,22,34,36,24,41}
age.add(56)
print(age)
age.remove(22)
print(age)
age.pop()
print(age)
```
```
A={1,2,3}
B={1,2,3,4,5}
C={100,101,102}
print(A.issubset(B))
print(B.issuperset(A))
print(A.isdisjoint(B))
print(B.isdisjoint(C))
```
```
# discard method returns no error
bricsnation={"B","R","I","C","S"}
bricsnation.discard("Z")
print(bricsnation)
# remove method returns error if not there
bricsnation.remove("Z")
print(bricsnation)
```
