Strings are sequence of characters stored a variable enclosed in double or single quotes
```py
username=input("please enter your name:")
print("Hello",username)
```
note:
>here "," added a space between the words Hello and username
>==not preferred==

### string.format -to do simple positional formatting
format method formats the specified values and inserts them inside the strings ==placeholder==.
	placeholder is defined using curly brackets {}
```py
name=input("Enter your name:")
age=input("Enter your age:")
print("Hello,{}.You are {} years old".format(name,age))
```
### format placeholders
identified using named indexes {price}, numbered indexes {0}, empty placeholders {}
	indexes are basically the count that starts from zero for the parameters passed to the format() method
```py
stringone="My name is {fname}, Iam {age} years old".format(fname="john",age=36)
stringtwo="My name is {0}, Iam {1} years old".format("john",36)
stringthree="My name is {}, Iam {} years old".format("john",36)
```
### Fstrings 
they provide a way to embed expressions inside string literals using a minimal syntax
	- fstring is just string with prefix 'f' that has expressions inside braces so that expressions are replaced with their values
	- formatted similar to str.format()
	- fstrings are evaluated at run time and not a constant
	- this is powerful
```py
name=input("Enter the name:")
print(f"Hello,{name}!")
```
- you can also embed arbitary python expressions in fstring and perform various kind of operations
note:
>no space between prefix f and start of string

```py
num1=5
num2=15
print(f"the sum is {num1 + num2}")
```
### Accessing values
**Concept of index**
- when work with sequences concept of index plays an important role
- index is numerical representation of items position in a sequence
- sequence refers to -list, string of characters, arbitrary sequence of values
- numerical representation starts from zero
```py
appname="PythonX"
print(appname[0])
print(appname[3])
```
`variable_name[index_number]`

### Slicing in python
obtaing sub-string from the given string by slicing it from start to end
	- extracting parts using specified index
	- like accessing using index we can slice using index
`string[start:end:step]`
>note:
>	start index (included) and end at end of index (excluded)\
>		step parameter is optional

sub string = original string
```py
appname="pythonX"
print(appname=[:])
print(appname=[::])
```
with parameters
```py
appname=pythonX
print(appname[:4])
print(appname[2:5])
print(appname[3:])
print(appname[::2])
```
***negative index***
- starts from where the sequence ends 
- from -1 -2 and so on
- first element of negative index is -1
### String operations
***Concatenation***
- combining two strings ie. addition of two strings
using 2 methods
1. Using + operator
>sting are immutable(cannot be changed) and so assigned to a new variable
```py
firstname="john"
lastname="david"
fullname=firstname + lastname
print(fullname)

#but fullname variable wont have space between them so add manually
fullname=firstname + " " + lastname 
```
2. Using join() method
> A string method to joins elements of sequence joined by mentioned separator
```py
firstname="john"
lastname="Doe"
print(" ".join([firstname, lastname]))
```
you can pass the string to be combined in \[] in join() method and mention the separator in the "" before the join() method.
**Repetition**
- creating new string by concatenating copies of same string
- * operator is used for string repetition by multiplication of string using integer value
```py
str="python"
print(str*2)
```
### String methods
- build-in methods
- to perform various operations and manipulate strings

**capitalize()** - convert first character to uppercase and all  the other characters to lowercase
**count(x)** - returns the number of times a specified value occurs in a string
**find(x)** - searches the string for a specified value and returns the position where it was found, if not
found it will return -1
**index(x)** - searches the string for a specified value and returns the index of position where it was found, if it is not found it will throw an exception (error)
**isalnum()** - returns true if all characters in the string are alphanumeric
**isalpha()** - returns true if all characters in the string are in alphabet
**islower()** - returns true if all characters in the string are in lowercase
**isupper()** - returns true if all characters in the string are in uppercase
**join()** - joins the elements of an iterable to the end of the string
**lower()** - converts a string into lowercase
**replace(a,b)** - returns a string where a specified value is replaced with a specified value
**strip()** - returns a trimmed version of the string i.e. it removes whitespaces from both the ends
**upper()** - converts a string into uppercase

```py
str="python"
print(str.islower())
print(str.lower())
print(str.upper())
print(str.replace('p','a'))
```
**len()** - accepts a string as parameter and returns the length of the string , it also counts all the whitespaces in the string
```py
str="Love python"
print(len(str))
```
