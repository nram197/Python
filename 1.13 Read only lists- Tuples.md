- similar to list
- a sequence data type
- store multiple values in a single variable
- tuples are immutable i.e. values of tuples cannot be changed
- to restrict the manipulation of lists - we can only fetch and read these values
- allows to store duplicate values
- ordered collection of multiple values
- tuples are created in () parenthesis and can have any number of items of different types
```py
# empty tuple
tuple1=() 
tuple2=(1,4,6,3,9)
tuple3=("john",23.56.0,True)
```
### Manipulation of tuples
**accessing elements of tuples** - using index
**tuple slicing**
```py
languages=("python","rust","java","ruby","lua")
print(languages)
print(languages[0])
print(languages[2])
# performing slicing
print(languages[1:4])
```
**updating a tuple** - cannot be updated since tuples are immutable
**deleting elements from a tuple** - removing/deleting individual tuple elements is not possible using del keyword entire tuple can be deleted
```py
tuple1=(12,56,98)
print(tuble1)
del tuple1
```
### Basic operations in tuple
similar to lists 
==Note: the results of these operations is always a new tuple since we cannot manipulate the existing tuple==
**concatenation** - using +
**repetition** - using *
```py
tuple1=(1,2,3)
tuple2=(4,5,6)
print(tuple1+tuple2)
print(tuple1*3)
```
**membership** -  
```py
names=("sam","mike","kane","nick")
print("sam" in names)
print("samuel" in names)
```
**Iterating** - using for loop

### Tuple functions
built-in function
**len(tuple)** - returns the length of the tuples
**min(tuple)** - returns the element of the tuples with the minimum value
**max(tuple)** - returns the elements of the tuples with the maximum value
```py
numbers=(3,56,13,98,33)
print(len(numbers))
print(min(numbers))
print(max(numbers))
```
**index(element)** - returns the index of the first matched item
**count(element)** - returns count of how many times elements occurs in the tuple
```
example=(23,45,67,23,89,1)
print(example.count(23))
print(example.index(67))
```

note: since tuples are immutable append(),insert(),remove(),pop() which manipulate and modify the sequence hence cannot be used
### Advantages of tuples
- tuples for heterogenous data types and lists for homogenous data types
- since tuples are immutable iterating through is faster than list so a slight performance boost while using tuples
- since tuples have immutable elements they can be used as key for a dictionary which is not possible with lists
- if you want your data to not change then implementing tuple will guarantee that it remains write-protected
