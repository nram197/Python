# Data
data stored in memory
when we want to label it as a piece of information we call it as **variable**
this can be fetched and manipulated at any instance in the program

## Requirements for variable

**Variable name
Assignment Operator (=)
	-for using name use ''.......''

### Rules
- variable name meaningful and descriptive
- must start with a letter or underscore
- cannot start with number
- case-sensitive
- name only alphanumeric and underscore
- a word or character should be in double or single quotes
## Data types

classification of data items
1- Numeric type
2- Sequence type
3- Boolean
4- Sets
5- Mapping type (dictionary)

#### Numeric data type

- Integer
- Floating point
- Complex
##### int
either positive or negative whole number
#### float
they are decimals
#### complex
imaginary numbers (a+bi) (a+bj)
i2=-1
real part = a
imaginary part = b
scientific computing
### Strings
sequence of characters
- conversion of characters to numbers (0 and 1) is called encoding and reverse is decoding
	ASCII(American Standard Code for Information Interchange) and UNICODE are some encoding from 0 to 127
	Python uses Unicode
- Strings are used with "....."
eg:   name="ram"
    print(name)
***multi-line string
- using """ and end with """
- stored and printed in the same format
eg: quote=""" iam the good boysfsfsfsfgdsgad
			gahahhah
			hfharhaha
			hafahafhafha"""

### Boolean
- True / False or Yes/ No
- compare two with conditions
- aka bool
- Variable name = boolean value (True or False)
## Check data type
***type()*** function is used to return data type of variable
- used for testing and debugging
eg:
	print(type(name))
