- a type of variable which allows us to store multiple values of various data types in a single variable
- sequence data structure like string
**key features**
1. lists are ==ordered== collections of multiple values
2. lists are ==mutable== i.e. values of list can be changed and manipulated over a period of time
3. lists allow us to store ==duplicate values==
>- lists created by placing them inside square brackets \[]
>-the elements inside lists are comma separated
>-it can have any number of items and they may be of different types (string, float, complex, integer, Boolean)

```py
list1=[]
list2=[1,2,3,4,5]
list3=["ram",25,30.6,True]
```
### Manipulating lists
1. Accessing elements of list
		using indices starting from zero
	```py
	names=["john","sam","barry","lin"]
	print(names)
	print(names[0])
	print(names[3])
	```
2. List slicing
	```py
	names=["john","sam","barry","lin"]
	print(names)
	print(names[1:3])
	print(names[2:])
	```
	
3. Updating a list
		using = (assignment operator)
	```py
	marks=[56,76,69,71,39]
	marks[4]=43
	print(marks)
	```

4. Deleting elements from a list
```py
	names=["john","sam","barry","lin"]
	print(names)
	del names[1]
	print(names)
	del names             # to delete whole list
```
### list operations
like strings operations are similar to lists also
1. Concatenation
		adding (+) two lists 
```py
list1=[1,2,3]
list2=[4,5,6]
print(list1+list2)
print(list1*3)
```
2. Repetition
		multiplying (*\) two lists
3. Membership
		==in== is used to test membership of an element in a list
```py
enrolledlist=["sam","mike","kane","nick"]
print("sam" in enrolledlist)
print("samuel" in enrolledlist)
```


```py
europe=["france","briton","germany","spain","peru","ukraine"]
del europe[4]
if ("peru" in europe):
	print("wrong contry still inside list")
else:
	print("all ok")
```

### looping in list
since we have fixed numbeer of iterations to be performed we use the ==for loop==
```py
fruits=["apple","peach","guava","papaya","mango"]
for i in fruits:
	print(i)
# checking for a value
for i==mango:
	print("mango supremacy")
	break
else:
	print("mango not found")
```
Note: 
	for-else statement
			if for statement iterations are exhausted then provide an else statement to execute some behaviour
```py
europe=["finland","ireland","iceland","poland","spain","netherland","france"]
for country in europe:
	if ("land" not in europe):
		print(country)
```
### some build-in functions

**len(list)** - returns the length of list
**min(list)** - returns the elements of list with minimum value
**max(list)** - returns the elements of list with maximum value
```py
numbers=[23,56,78,98,33]
print(len(numbers))
print(min(numbers))
print(max(numbers))
```
**append(element)** - adds the specified element to the end of the list
**insert(index, element)** - inserts an element at the specified index
**pop()** - removes and returns the last element from the list
**remove(element)** - removes the specified elements from the list
**reverse()** - reverse the order of items in the list
**index(element)** - returns the index of the first matched item
**count(element)** - returns count of how many times an element occurs in the list
```py
names=["james","sam","nick"]
print(names)
names=append("barry")
print(names)

names.insert(1,"ron")
print(names)

names.remove("nick")
print(names)

# print(age.count(18))
```
### Smart lists
There are instances where you need to create a list at runtime or create a list from another list or to create a list depending on user data
```py
even=[]
for x in range(1,11):
	if x%2 ==0:
		even.append(x)
	print(even)
```
### list comprehension
A better way to create list in python using mathematical statements and in a single line
**consists of**
- output expression
- input expression
- a variable representing a member of the input sequence
- an optional predicate part/condition
```py
even=[x for x in range(1,11) if x % 2==0]
print(even)
	# output expression is x
	# input expression is range(1,11)
	# a variable representing a member of the input sequence is x
	# an optional predicate part/condition is if x %2 ==0
```
```
# not all parts are mandatory
str=["Hello,List"]
characterlist=[x for x in str]
print(characterlist)
```
