**1.Arithmetic Operator**  - operands and operator
	+ 
	- 
	/
	*
	%(modulus) - returns remainder
	 \*\*(exponent) - power
	 //(truncation or floor division) - returns quotient
	 ==**PEMDAS** - ()parenthesis, \**(exponent) {\*(multiplication) /(division)} {+(addition) -(subtraction)}==
multiplication and division equal importance likewise addition and subtraction
they move from left to write
**2.Relational(comparitive)** - returns boolean value true or false
	\> - greater than
	\< - lesser than
	== - equal to
	!= - not equal to
	\>= - greater than or equal to
	\<= - lesser than or equal to
	
**3.Logical** - combines two or more expression to form compound expression 
		and - true if both operands are true
		or - true if either of one is true
		not - true if operand is false (complements)

**4.Membership and Identity** - to check if it is there or not
	**in** - true if value is found 
	**not in** - true if value is not found
identity - to check if two values are located on same part of memory
	**is** - true if operand is identical i.e.. same subject
	**not is** -true if operands are not identical i.e. not same subject
to print memory address of variable
	print(id(num))
	**id() method**
**5.Bitwise**
**6.Walrus** - new assignment operator
	a way to assign to variables within an expression using the notation
	name:=expr
	eg: print(name:=sam)
**7.Assignment**
	=
